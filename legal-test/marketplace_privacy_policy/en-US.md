### Firefox Marketplace Privacy Notice
January 14, 2015

We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you from the Firefox Marketplace, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

<u>Things you should know</u>

- Most of the apps on the Firefox Marketplace are not made by us and you should check their privacy policies before using them.
- Payments are processed by others (not Mozilla) and you should check the privacy policy of the applicable payment provider to understand their practices.
  - No financial information (such as credit card info that you have used to make purchases in the Firefox Marketplace) is collected, retained or used by Mozilla.
- The Firefox Marketplace uses cookies and other web technologies to provide its functionality (such as remembering you between sessions) and to help us understand how users use the service through aggregate analytics.
- The Marketplace may use your carrier and location data to customize your experience.
  - On Firefox OS devices, we use network information from your device to understand your country location and carrier network to customize your experience and offer special carrier content.
  - On all platforms, we may use your IP address to determine your country location to customize your experience.
- You don't have to log in to install a free app, but paid apps require login. We also help you maintain a history of your transactional activity (like which Apps you have purchased).
- For logged-in users, Firefox Marketplace uses your language, country, and installed apps to recommend additional apps that may be of interest.  This can be disabled in Account Settings.  [Learn More](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/recommendations-marketplace).
- You may elect to receive email from us and can unsubscribe from any email marketing communications you elected to receive.
